######  Prerequisites:
coming soon

###### Learning Outcomes:
1. Acquisition of updated knowledge on the neural bases of language. We will cover the functional and structural neural correlates of brain networks underlying language processing at different levels: phonological, semantic, syntactic, etc.
2. Develop scientific reasoning integrating experimental methods and the various language issues (different cerebral imaging techniques and what they allow to study, cerebral representation of different levels of language processing).

###### Description:
The course is made up of 7 sections:
* Overview of developmental, acquired, and neurodegenerative disorders affecting language (week 1 and 2)
* Overview of neuroimaging techniques and experimental paradigms that can be used to study language (week 3 and 4) 
* Speech perception and production (week 5 and 6)
* Reading and writing (week 7 and 8)
* Sign language (week 9)
* Semantic (week 10 and 11)
* Syntax and discourse (week 12 and 13)

###### Tools
Throughout the course we will be using the following tools:
* This jupyterbook and all the links here provided
* Ad-hoc slack channel (coming up)
* Zoom
* GoogleDrive

Please contact the instructor if you have any issue of access/availability with any of these software/platforms.

###### Schedule-driven grading
All students start the course with 100 points, and lose 2 points for every assignment that they don’t complete, discussion they don't participate in, syncronous meeeting they don't attend. 
Continuous monitoring.
•	Weekly questionnaires to be completed online (40% of grade). This will involve completing multiple-choice quizzes on the material presented in class, including the content of the guest scholars' presentations.
•	Written exam at the end of the course (40% of the mark).
•	Oral presentation of a scientific article and active participation in class (20% of the mark).


###### Flipped classroom
There are no standard lectures. Pre-recorded lecture videos and readings are provided. Students are required to watch/read them and complete a few questions. Weekly synchronous meetings are of two kinds
* Q&A - I answer questions previously posted online and on-the-spot ones
* Students-lead discussions around a predefined topic/problem
* Problem-solving or tutorials
